# Bike Rideshare Service Case Study

This case study is the capstone project to the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The data is from a fictional bike service called Cyclistic which aims convert their casual riders (single-ride or single-day subscribers) into annual membership subscribers. The goal is to find how both groups use with the service differently.

I have created a visual for my case study on Tableau Public which can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticData_16629159640350/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The data is supplied by [Divvy](https://www.divvybikes.com/about), and the dataset can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The dataset is available to the public under [this](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) license.

## Company Description

"In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime."
